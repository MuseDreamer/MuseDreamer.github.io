        <h2>About N0xt</h2>
        <p>
          N0xt is a band led by <strong>Ombra</strong>, the bassist and creative heart of the group.  
          Their sound blends analog distortion, electronic music, alt rock, and much more.
          This group is a experimental band at heart, so we may flip flop genre's, but that truly is the fun of it.
          The band is currently under the works though so currently there is no music out yet....  
        </p>
        <p>
          Each track serves as a conversation between hardware and heart, between the analog pulse and
          the digital storm. N0xt isn’t just music — it’s a signal from the future.
